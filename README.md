# bdd-unit-example
Following principles at John Ferguson Smart's book *BDD in action*, I made this example of how to let BDD & TDD cycle design your code using Cucumber & JUnit.
## Installation
First of all you need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) installed. Once you have it, in order to build the project, just follow the next steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/eduriol/bdd-unit-example.git
cd bdd-unit-example
mvn package
```
Build will succeed if tests pass.
## Execution
Every time you need to re-run the tests, just execute the following command:
```
mvn test
```
